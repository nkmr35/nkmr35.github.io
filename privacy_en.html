<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="summary">
  Update time: 2025-10-23
</p>

<p>The Privacy Policy and Terms of Use are extended from Apple's standard EULA (<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/</a>)</p>

<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there is any content not mentioned in this clause, but mentioned in the EULA, the EULA shall prevail.</li>
  <li>If there is any conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the EULA, these Terms and Conditions shall prevail.</li>
</ul>

<p>We value your privacy and are committed to protecting the data you provide when using our apps. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using our services.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our App and is effective for visitors to our App with respect to the information shared and/or collected in our App. This policy does not apply to any information collected offline or through channels other than our App, nor does it apply to situations where you communicate with us directly through social media or email.</p>

<h2>About Personal Information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Except for limited purchase/subscription data processed via our third‑party provider RevenueCat (see "Use of RevenueCat" below), we do not collect your personal information (such as name, gender, email address, mobile phone number, address, etc.).</li>
  <li>We will not ask you to provide personal contact information (such as name, gender, email address, mobile phone number, address, etc.).</li>
  <li>We do not store your in‑app content data on our servers.</li>
  <li>Your in‑app data is saved on your device and we have no access to it.</li>
  <li>If you enable iCloud synchronization/backup, your data will be stored in Apple's iCloud services and will consume your iCloud storage. We do not have access to this data.</li>
  <li>You have 100% control over your data and you are responsible for your data. If your device fails, we cannot help recover your local data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important reminder:</strong> To protect your privacy, data generated within the App is tied to your Apple ID/iTunes ID. If you switch Apple IDs and do not enable iCloud synchronization, your in‑app data may be automatically deleted by Apple's security policy. Purchases and subscriptions are not affected.</p>

<h2>Use of RevenueCat (in‑app purchases and subscriptions)</h2>

<p>We use RevenueCat solely to provide and manage in‑app purchases and subscriptions (including entitlement verification and restore). This is the only case where limited data leaves your device for processing.</p>

<h3>Categories of data processed by RevenueCat:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An automatically generated, pseudonymous App User ID (we do not attach your name, email, or phone number).</li>
  <li>Apple App Store receipt and transaction metadata: product identifiers (SKUs), purchase dates, subscription status (active/expired/canceled), trial/grace period information, and price/currency as provided by Apple.</li>
  <li>Basic app/device/context data for service operation and fraud prevention: app version, OS/platform, locale/region, and IP address (the latter may be processed by RevenueCat's servers to derive region and for security).</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not receive your payment card details or your Apple ID email; payments are processed by Apple.</p>

<h3>Purpose of processing:</h3>

<p>To deliver and verify purchases, manage entitlements, restore purchases, prevent fraud/abuse, localize offers/prices, provide customer support related to purchases.</p>

<h3>Legal bases (where applicable):</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Performance of a contract (to provide the purchased service/features).</li>
  <li>Compliance with legal obligations (e.g., tax and recordkeeping).</li>
  <li>Our legitimate interests (e.g., fraud prevention and service reliability).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data recipients and sharing:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Apple (App Store infrastructure) and RevenueCat act as service providers to process purchases/subscriptions.</li>
  <li>We do not share your data with advertising networks and do not use it for targeted advertising.</li>
  <li>For details, please see RevenueCat's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Retention:</h3>

<p>RevenueCat retains purchase/entitlement records as necessary to provide the service and as required by law.</p>

<p>Uninstalling the App does not cancel subscriptions and does not remove purchase records stored with Apple/RevenueCat. You can manage or cancel subscriptions here: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions">https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions</a></p>

<h3>Your choices and deletion:</h3>

</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing and Protection:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We do not share personal information with any third party without your consent, unless permitted or required by law.</li>
  <li>RevenueCat and Apple process purchase/subscription data to the extent necessary to provide the service. We take reasonable security measures to protect data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Safety measures:</strong> We take reasonable security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure or misuse.</p>

  <li>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information.</li>
  <li>In certain circumstances, you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal information.</li>
