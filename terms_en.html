<h2>Relationship with Apple's Standard EULA</h2>

<p>These Pro Subscription Terms extend Apple's Standard EULA: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>If a matter is covered by the EULA but not addressed here, the EULA controls.</li>
  <li>If there is any conflict between these Terms and the EULA, these Terms prevail to the extent permitted by the EULA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Acceptance</h2>

<p>By purchasing or using the Focus Pro subscription (the "Pro Subscription"), you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>Service description</h2>

<ul>
  <li>While your Pro Subscription is active, you can access Focus Pro features during the applicable subscription period.</li>
  <li>Pro features and their availability may change or be discontinued at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Auto‑renewable subscription</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pro is offered as an auto‑renewable subscription (e.g., monthly or annual) and starts upon purchase confirmation by Apple.</li>
  <li>The subscription automatically renews unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
  <li>Your Apple ID account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
  <li>Uninstalling the App does not cancel your subscription.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managing and canceling</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Manage or cancel your subscription in Apple ID settings: iOS Settings > Your Name > Subscriptions or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions">https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions</a></li>
  <li>Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. Access continues until the current period expires. No partial refunds for the remaining period.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Free trials and introductory offers (if available)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If a free trial or introductory offer is provided, it is typically limited to one per Apple ID per product.</li>
  <li>If you do not cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends, it will convert to a paid subscription and you will be charged.</li>
  <li>Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Payment, pricing, and taxes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Payment is processed by Apple. Apple is the merchant of record. We do not receive your card details.</li>

  <li>We may change prices and/or plans. Price increases or changes may be notified by Apple and will apply starting from the next renewal.</li>
